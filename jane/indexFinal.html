    <p>
      Welcome to my collection of quilts and fabric art. I am a hobbyist and chose the quilt designs from simple to complex as my skills and confidence grew, learning many different techniques along the way.<br>
	  While each quilt is unique, they share a love of color, pattern, and detail.<br><br>
      Many of these pieces were created as special gifts, for charity fundraisers or commissions (and, of course, for my personal enjoyment).
