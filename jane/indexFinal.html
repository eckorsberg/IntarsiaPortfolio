  <h1>🧵 Jane Korsberg's Quilt Portfolio</h1>

  <!-- Simple intro (no about.html link, no laser/animation references) -->
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      Welcome to my collection of quilts and fabric art. Many of these pieces were
      created as special gifts or commissions, often inspired by the stories and
      lives of the people they were made for.
    </p>
    <p>
      While each quilt is unique, they share a love of color, pattern, and detail —
      from whimsical children’s themes to tributes inspired by books, music, and
      personal milestones.
