3. **SEO**: Add meta tags (title, description, OG tags) to individual project pages.
4. **Gallery Sort Toggle**: Allow users to switch between newest-first and oldest-first display.
5. **Image Lazy Loading**: Improve performance by adding `loading="lazy"` to thumbnails.
6. **CMS Automation**: Consider a script or simple CMS backend for editing gallery.json if scale increases.

Verdict:
This site is well-crafted and purpose-fit for showcasing handmade wood art. It balances clarity, speed, and usability without overengineering. No changes are necessary unless you're seeking polish or additional functionality.
