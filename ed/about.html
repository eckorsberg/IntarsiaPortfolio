      <p>Welcome to my collection of handcrafted woodworking art: Intarsia, cutting boards, miscellaneous wood crafts and now laser etching.<br>
      While I hand made all these items, there are multiple artists or pattern designers responsible for the original artistic pattern.<br>
      Originally I purchased patterns from various artists but I am increasingly designing my own patterns now.</p>
	
	  <p>My initial adventure in woodworking started with turning bowls on a lathe. Eventually I discovered scroll saw projects, and then the beautiful challenge of Intarsia.</p>
      <p>
        I took an introductory Intarsia class from Kathy Wise at the Marc Adams School of Woodworking 
        and from there continued on my own adventure.

	  <p>Most patterns are inspired by artists like Kathy Wise, Judy Gale Roberts, Bruce Worthington, Janette Square and others. Some patterns are my own, based on photos I adapted into designs.</p>
	  <p>In many cases, the woods used or the number of pieces were recorded. In others, I simply estimated.  I have used other exotic woods across these designs but when I was writing this web page I was unable to recall some of them.  Some are regulars that I can easily identify such as Yellowheart, Redheart, Sycamore, Aspen, Sepele, Honey Locust but many others are not distinct enough in the pictures for me to identify.</p>

	  <p>Here is an article written by Michelle Collins of the Solon Times showcasing my recent exploration into the art of Intarsia woodworking.<br>

	  <p>Here is a description of Intarsia</p>
	  <div class="intro-text"><b>
	  Intarsia is a form of woodworking that involves creating pictures or designs by using different types of woods, each with its own natural color and grain pattern.<br>
	  The individual pieces of woods are carefully cut and shaped to fit together like a puzzle.<br>
	  Think of it as painting with wood.</b></div>
