  <h1>About This Portfolio</h1>
  <p>My initial adventure in woodworking started with turning bowls on a lathe. Eventually I discovered scroll saw projects, and then the beautiful challenge of Intarsia.</p>
  <p>Most patterns are inspired by artists like Kathy Wise and Judy Gale Roberts. Some are my own, based on photos I adapted into designs.</p>
  <p>In many cases, the woods used or the number of pieces were recorded. In others, I simply estimated.  I have used other exotic woods across these designs but when I was writing this web page I was unable to recall some of them.  Some are regulars that I can easily identify such as Yellowheart, Redheart,Sycamore, Aspen, Sepele Honey Locust but many others are not distinct enough in the pictures for me to identify.</p>

	<p>Here is a description of Intarsia</p>
	<div class="intro-text"><b>Intarsia is a form of woodworking that
	involves creating pictures or designs
	by using different types of woods, each
	with its own natural color and grain
	pattern.<br>The individual pieces of woods
	are carefully cut and shaped to fit together
	like a puzzle.<br>Think of it as painting with
	wood.</b></div>
