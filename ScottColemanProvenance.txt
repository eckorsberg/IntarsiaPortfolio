Provenance Statement
Title: Guardian Dragon
Medium: Intarsia woodworking, exotic hardwoods, hand-shaped and finished
Dimensions: 19x16 inches
Date Created: 2024
Artist: Ed Korsberg

Based on a pattern design by the late Bruce Worthington, this one-of-a-kind intarsia dragon was further embellished by the artist to add additional detail and dimensionality. The work was designed, cut, shaped, and finished entirely by hand using a selection of exotic hardwoods chosen for their natural grain and coloration. No paints or stains were used; each piece was shaped to fit precisely into the composition, giving the finished work both depth and textural richness.

In July 2025, the work was acquired by a private collector residing in New York City, whose art holdings include notable contemporary and traditional works. The purchase reflected the collector’s recognition of the rarity and craftsmanship of the piece.

The collector has designated that his personal art collection, including this Dragon, will be bequeathed upon his death to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. As such, this work is destined for inclusion in the museum’s permanent collection, ensuring its preservation and public exhibition for future generations.
