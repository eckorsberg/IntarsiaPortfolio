  <h1>Intarsia Wood Art Gallery</h1>
  <p>This is a simple old fashioned static HTML (and some CSS) webpage showcasing my woodworking projects of Intarsia, cutting boards and other miscellaneous wood crafts.  <br>I am not motivated yet to make a professional modern fancy webpage that would require more work and the cost of hosting a custom website.</p>
  <p>Here is a nice article written by the Solon Times in regard to my recent exploration into the art of Intarsia woodworking.

  <p>I initially started turning spindles and bowls on a wood lathe but after a while it become seemingly repeatative.  Next came doing scrollsaw work and that was more varied and fulfulling.  But then I took a class at the <a href="https://www.marcadams.com">Marc Adams School of woodworking</a> on something called Intarsia and this art form really appealed to me.  It seems few people practice this form of woodworking but it seems to fit me well.</p>

  <p>Here is a nice description of Intarsia</p>
	<div><b>Intarsia is a form of woodworking that
	involves creating pictures or designs
	by using different types of woods, each
	with its own natural color and grain
	pattern.<br>The individual pieces of woods
	are carefully cut and shaped to fit together
	like a puzzle.<br>Think of it as painting with
	wood.</b></div>
